During the **Piscine Reload** week, I worked with many functions I was already familiar with from the original **Piscine**. 🧠 I also **refreshed** some shell terminal commands and gained new knowledge through the more advanced exercises, where I learned about **Makefiles** and **data structures**. 📂✨ All of this knowledge will definitely be useful for the **Common Core** that I’m currently diving into. 🚀
